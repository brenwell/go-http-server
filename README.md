BusyBox with HTTPie-go

This version of the standard busybox container but adds an HTTPie executable. (busybox: https://busybox.net/about.html). Similar to https://github.com/joncrlsn/busybox but build for multi-architecture

Thank you to :

    the creators of HTTPie: https://httpie.org/
    Yusuke Nojima for creating a Go version of HTTPie: https://github.com/nojima/httpie-go
    Joncrlson for the original version: https://github.com/joncrlsn/busybox
